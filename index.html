        <h3>Hello and Welcome</h3>
        <p>Date: December 9, 2023</p>
        <p>Hello! this is my personal website designed by Me! If you are here it is
            because in a way you find me interesting. Here I will let all my thoughts
            go and I will be transparent as possible. I recently started a youtube channel
            so if you are here might as well go check that out! I will leave a link for it
            on my socials section. I have also started posting a lot more on TikTok which
            is good because I would love to use my platform for good and to do something
            better with my life. My life is well, I learned to be thankful for what I have
            already, because even though it is not a lot; others might have it way worse.
            So always be thankful for what you have already, someone else is just trying to
            get where you are while you are complaining about it. Life is hard in general,
            everything you will ever do will be hard; you just have to choose which hard you
            want. Being in shape is hard but also being overweight, being financially independant
            is hard but so is being broke, being in control of yourself is hard but so is being
            in prison, well you get the point. BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY!</p>
