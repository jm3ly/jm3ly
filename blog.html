            <h3>Hello and Welcome</h3>
            <p>Date: December 9, 2023</p>
            <p>Hello! this is my personal website designed by Me! If you are here it is
                because in a way you find what I am doing interesting. Here I will let all my thoughts
                go and I will be transparent as possible. I recently started a youtube channel
                so if you are here might as well go check that out! I will leave a link for it
                on my socials section. I have also started posting a lot more on TikTok which
                is good because I would love to use my platform for good and to do something
                better with my life. My life is well, I learned to be thankful for what I have
                already, because even though it is not a lot; others might have it way worse.
                So always be thankful for what you have already, someone else is just trying to
                get where you are while you are complaining about it. Life is hard in general,
                everything you will ever do will be hard; you just have to choose which hard you
                want. Being in shape is hard but also being overweight, being financially independant
                is hard but so is being broke, being in control of yourself is hard but so is being
                in prison, well you get the point. BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY!</p>

            <p>Reading is by far one of the best ways to learn. If you are not engaging in matter that
                interests you.. what exactly are you doing? Pick up a book about something you enjoy, personally 
                I would pick up a book about the psychology of humans and money. Definitely some about computers,
                programming and what-not but I also enjoy reading a good story.. mostly if they are true. Right now
                I am reading the forty-eight laws of power, this book is one of the best I have read. I 
                recommend this book to anyone, now it is your choice if you want to read it or not. I almost want
                to gatekeep it, it is that good. I am going to film another workout video today as well, hopefully 
                better than the last. My last video is not getting that much traction but that is not what I am 
                looking for with these videos. These are for me to watch in the future when I am older. The 
                attention I recieve or will recieve is extra and for that I am thankful now and always. Stay blessed

            <p> Today I am grateful that I woke up. Not everyday is promised so everyday should be thanked for. Today 
                I went to the gym and worked out legs for about an hour. I have been trying to record myself doing my 
                workouts so I can post them on my YouTube, something that I have been trying to do for a while now. I 
                have one video up right now and one that I need to edit and upload. After my workout today my mother and 
                I went to go pick up Olive Garden and two pizzas to eat wiht my uncle and his family. Christmas is almost 
                here and that is always a fun time during the year. Right now I am happy that everyone is well, some 
                people that I have known over the years aren't here anymore so the fact that everyone is here makes 
                me happy. I hope everyone reading this had a good day and a good year. - JM3LY

            <p> I am currently at work and moved my head to the right and my whole neck just popped like crazy. You know 
                reading these back I wonder to myself if I am ever going to go back and read these and to be honest I don't
                know if I will. For the meantime I would love to think I will but thinking about it what if something happens to
                me? Nobody really knows I have this website unless I tell them. Maybe this will be a famous webiste one day with 
                all my memorabilia in display on the website. That thought came across my head and I would love to go back and 
                read these one day. Today I feel hopeful for a better tomorrow; I am trying to learn the importance of living in 
                the present and not the past nor the future. Living in the present gives you a better life in all aspects. 
                Worry about what you can control today, the rest will come in due time. Love and peace - JM3LY

            <p> It is Christmas Eve! First of all I hope everyone reading this had an amazing Christmas 2023. I hope you got 
                everything you wanted. All I wanted was peace and love, something that wasn't manageable either this year but it is
                okay it is only human nature to look for ways to put the blame on others so it is alright. I have decided for the 
                year 2024 my main goal is to have a better schedule for myself and to actually follow through with my schedule. I feel 
                like this year I have not been dedicated to my schedule. I feel like I have been slacking mostly, this 
                next year I need to commit to myself because oneself is the only person that is really going to push you. My cousin and uncle came
                to visit our family from Georgia last night, I didn't see them until this morning. Overall I am kinda sad about what my mom told
                me but that is not something I want to discuss, just state. Anyways, I hope everyone has a great Christmas and give yourself 
                to Jesus Christ and get saved. - Peace and Prosperity
