            <h3>Goals for Next Year and NYE</h3>
            <p>Date: December 27, 2023</p>
            <p>The year really about to end pretty soon, in 4 days it will be a new year, 2024. Like I mentioned earlier my main goal for this year 
                is to be more resposible with my schedule and really commit to what I am doing. This year I have come a long way in coding and programming.
                5 months in I can create all this without looking up much. Ai helps a lot when I don't understand something, it makes it so much easier
                to learn and adapt. So this next year I want to continue doing that. I got a new water color set that my mother gave me, I want to use it 
                to create paintings and show them to the world via a new Website that I will develop for them. The riches come when one is working on 
                themselves not for others. And riches not just in paper currency but in individual riches like one's mental and physical state. Talking 
                about physical, I want to be more commited to my physical, I have been having spine issues from my neck all the way to the middle of my back.
                 It still hurts to this day, and I injured it in August of this year. I hope it goes back to normal because it does affect my daily life. Overall 
                 from the time I am writing this I am having a fairly good day. I woke up at 7:30 AM, went to work at 8 and I have been here since.
                 -it is now 1:27 PM- I will be geting a haircut Todayand traveling to the beach tomorrow. I don't know how many entries ill write there but i 
                 will try to get at least one. I am also going to shoot for filming a video about our whole trip and also about individual things. Definitely going to try to
                 film tiktoks and get pictures for the gram. I will update later but these were Quick Thoughts.. I am out. - JM3LY

            <h3>Christmas Eve Reflection</h3>
            <p>Date: December 24, 2023</p>
            <p>It is Christmas Eve! First of all, I hope everyone reading this had an amazing Christmas 2023. I hope you got 
                everything you wanted. All I wanted was peace and love, something that wasn't manageable either this year but it is
                okay it is only human nature to look for ways to put the blame on others so it is alright. I have decided for the 
                year 2024 my main goal is to have a better schedule for myself and to actually follow through with my schedule. I feel 
                like this year I have not been dedicated to my schedule. I feel like I have been slacking mostly; this 
                next year I need to commit to myself because oneself is the only person that is really going to push you. My cousin and uncle came
                to visit our family from Georgia last night, I didn't see them until this morning. Overall I am kinda sad about what my mom told
                me but that is not something I want to discuss, just state. Anyways, I hope everyone has a great Christmas and give yourself 
                to Jesus Christ and get saved. - Peace and Prosperity

            <h3>Hopeful Tomorrow</h3>
            <p>Date: December 16, 2023</p>
            <p>I am currently at work and moved my head to the right, and my whole neck just popped like crazy. You know 
                reading these back I wonder to myself if I am ever going to go back and read these, and to be honest I don't
                know if I will. For the meantime, I would love to think I will, but thinking about it, what if something happens to
                me? Nobody really knows I have this website unless I tell them. Maybe this will be a famous website one day with 
                all my memorabilia in display on the website. That thought came across my head, and I would love to go back and 
                read these one day. Today I feel hopeful for a better tomorrow; I am trying to learn the importance of living in 
                the present and not the past nor the future. Living in the present gives you a better life in all aspects. 
                Worry about what you can control today; the rest will come in due time. Love and peace - JM3LY

            <h3>Gratitude</h3>
            <p>Date: December 14, 2023</p>
            <p>Today I am grateful that I woke up. Not every day is promised, so every day should be thanked for. Today 
                I went to the gym and worked out legs for about an hour. I have been trying to record myself doing my 
                workouts so I can post them on my YouTube, something that I have been trying to do for a while now. I 
                have one video up right now and one that I need to edit and upload. After my workout today, my mother and 
                I went to go pick up Olive Garden and two pizzas to eat with my uncle and his family. Christmas is almost 
                here, and that is always a fun time during the year. Right now, I am happy that everyone is well; some 
                people that I have known over the years aren't here anymore, so the fact that everyone is here makes 
                me happy. I hope everyone reading this had a good day and a good year. - JM3LY

            <h3>Life</h3>
            <p>Date: December 12, 2023</p>
            <p>Reading is by far one of the best ways to learn. If you are not engaging in matter that
                interests you, what exactly are you doing? Pick up a book about something you enjoy, personally, 
                I would pick up a book about the psychology of humans and money. Definitely some about computers,
                programming and whatnot, but I also enjoy reading a good story, mostly if they are true. Right now
                I am reading the forty-eight laws of power; this book is one of the best I have read. I 
                recommend this book to anyone; now it is your choice if you want to read it or not. I almost want
                to gatekeep it; it is that good. I am going to film another workout video today as well, hopefully, 
                better than the last. My last video is not getting that much traction, but that is not what I am 
                looking for with these videos. These are for me to watch in the future when I am older. The 
                attention I receive or will receive is extra and for that I am thankful now and always. Stay blessed

            <h3>Hello and Welcome</h3>
            <p>Date: December 9, 2023</p>
            <p>Hello! This is my personal website designed by me! If you are here, it is
                because in a way you find what I am doing interesting. Here I will let all my thoughts
                go, and I will be transparent as possible. I recently started a YouTube channel,
                so if you are here, you might as well go check that out! I will leave a link for it
                on my socials section. I have also started posting a lot more on TikTok, which
                is good because I would love to use my platform for good and to do something
                better with my life. Life is hard in general,
                everything you will ever do will be hard; you just have to choose which hard you
                want. Being in shape is hard, but so is being overweight, being financially independent
                is hard, but so is being broke, being in control of yourself is hard, but so is being
                in prison. Well, you get the point. BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY!</p>
